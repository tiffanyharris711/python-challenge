### Python homework, week 3

There are two Python scripts to run in this project: main.py in the PyBank folder and main.py in the PyPoll folder.

Recap of main.py for PyBank:
*The data file 'budget_data.csv' is located and read from the 'Resources' folder.
*The final financial analysis prints to the terminal and to a text file located in the 'analysis' folder.
*Not including the header row, script counts the number of rows and records as the total number of months in the financial data
*Each month displays the profit or loss for that period. The total in the financial analysis summary adds the all profits and losses for an overall net total.
*The average change is calculated by adding up all the monthly changes and dividing by the number of months. The monthly change is calculated by subtracting one month profit/loss from the previous month profit/loss. 
*The greatest increase represents the month and value with the largest monthly change in profit.
*The greatest decrease represents the month and value with the largest monthly change in loss. 

Recap of main.py for PyPoll:
*The data file 'election_data.csv' is located and read from the 'Resources' folder.
*The final election results prints to the terminal and to a text file located in the 'analysis' folder.
*Not including the header row, script counts the number of rows and records as the total number of votes.
*The summary breaks down the recap of votes and percent of total votes by candidate.
*The election winner is Khan.
